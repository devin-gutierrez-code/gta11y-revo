=== GTA11Y Navigation Assist v3.0 - Multi-Directional + Waypoint + Enemy Detection ===
Updated: January 29, 2026

NEW FEATURES IN v3.0:
=====================

1. WAYPOINT TRACKING SYSTEM (NumPad Decimal Key)
   - Press NumPad Decimal when a waypoint is set to toggle tracking
   - Announces: "Waypoint tracking. X meters [direction]. Facing [heading]"
   - Continuous directional beeps guide you to the waypoint
   - Beep panning: Left ear = turn left, Right ear = turn right, Center = going straight
   - Beep interval: Faster when closer, slower when farther (200ms-1000ms)
   - Beep pitch: Higher when facing waypoint, lower when facing away
   - Auto-announces "Arrived at waypoint" within 10m
   - Auto-announces "Waypoint cleared" if waypoint is removed
   - Press again to stop tracking: "Waypoint tracking stopped"
   - If no waypoint set, just announces current heading as before

2. ENEMY DETECTION SYSTEM (Automatic)
   - Scans for hostile peds every 2 seconds within 100m
   - Detects: Peds in combat against player, peds with Hate/Dislike relationship
   - Announces: "X hostile(s) detected" when enemies found
   - Continuous tracking beeps for closest enemy (every 300ms)
   - Directional audio: Panned left/right based on enemy position
   - Pitch: Higher when enemy is closer (more urgent)
   - Harsh sawtooth waveform distinguishes from other beeps
   - Auto-removes dead enemies from tracking

3. MULTI-DIRECTIONAL NAVIGATION (Existing, Enhanced)
   - Detects obstacles in LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT zones
   - Full stereo panning for spatial awareness
   - Speed-based detection range and intervals in vehicles

AUDIO OUTPUTS SUMMARY:
======================
| System           | Waveform  | Frequency    | Pan              |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Nav - Peds       | Triangle  | 150-400 Hz   | By direction     |
| Nav - Vehicles   | Sawtooth  | 300-800 Hz   | By direction     |
| Nav - World      | Square    | 200-600 Hz   | By direction     |
| Waypoint         | Sine      | 200-600 Hz   | By direction     |
| Enemy            | Sawtooth  | 400-800 Hz   | By direction     |

CONTROLS:
=========
NumPad Decimal:
- No waypoint: Announces "facing [direction]"
- Waypoint exists: Toggles waypoint tracking on/off
- First press: "Waypoint tracking. 500 meters North. Facing East"
- Second press: "Waypoint tracking stopped. Facing East"

WAYPOINT BEEP BEHAVIOR:
=======================
- Distance interval: 200ms (close) to 1000ms (far)
- Pitch feedback:
  - Facing directly at waypoint: 600 Hz (high, positive)
  - Facing away: 200 Hz (low, turn around)
  - Perpendicular: 400 Hz (medium)
- Panning:
  - Waypoint to your left: Left speaker
  - Waypoint to your right: Right speaker
  - Waypoint ahead: Both speakers

ENEMY DETECTION CRITERIA:
=========================
- Ped.IsInCombatAgainst(Player)
- Relationship == Hate or Dislike
- Currently in combat AND shooting at player

TECHNICAL NOTES:
================
- World.WaypointBlip used to get waypoint position
- Function.Call<bool>(Hash.IS_WAYPOINT_ACTIVE) checks if waypoint exists
- trackedEnemies list maintains hostile peds between scans
- Dead enemies auto-removed from tracking list
- All new audio uses mono SignalGenerator for PanningSampleProvider compatibility

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
- GTA11Y.cs: Added waypoint tracking and enemy detection systems
- New member variables for audio outputs and tracking state
- Enhanced NumPad Decimal key handler
- New tick-based systems in onTick method
